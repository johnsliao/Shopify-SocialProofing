		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

		<b>What is the procedure to install this app?</b>
		<p>Click the installation button “Get” button. After approving the permissions that app requires, you will be redirected to the Social Proof Samurai settings page. We set the default social proof settings for you, but feel free to edit them to your best
			interest.
		</p>

    <b>When will my social proof data get refreshed?</b>
		<p>We update our databases with your store social proof data every few hours.</p>

    <b>No pop up is showing on my product pages</b>
    <p>At a minimum, Social Proof Samurai check orders within the last 7 days (You can also change how far Social Proof Samurai looks back in time in the app settings page). If a product does not have an order within that time, then no pop up will appear.</p>
    <p>If you had an order within the last 7 days (or the time you set for Social Proof Samurai to look back), then your theme files may be preventing it from popping up. Please follow the manual installation instructions <a href=src="https://socialproof-samurai.herokuapp.com/installation_guide">here</a>. </p>

		<b>Will this affect my theme files?</b>
		<p>No. This app does not make any changes to your theme/liquid files.</p>

		<p>Please contact us at socialproof.samurai@gmail.com. We will get back to you within 24-48 hours.</p>
